          <p class="text-center1">Choosing the right school marks a new beginning in the life of your child. Taking one‚Äôs time to
           explore educational options is an important decision for any family or parent. Greensprings 
           School has been a co-educational school for more than 30 years; we understand how boys and 
           girls learn and grow. We seek to aid the development of children in our care as scholars, 
           athletes, artists and citizens by instilling in them the spirit of excellence.</p>
           <p class="text-center1">Well-rounded education is of paramount importance at Greensprings School. We guide all students 
          to develop personal integrity and leadership skills on which they can draw for the rest of their 
          lives. We would love to help you understand the unique benefits that we have to offer at 
          Greensprings School, where we encourage each child to develop as a lifelong and confident learner.
          <p class="text-center1">When you choose Greensprings School, you will be joining a welcoming and supportive community 
          which encourages the diverse faculty and student body that mirrors the world around us. We strive 
          to build productive and long lasting relationships as students, teachers, and parents.</p>
          <p class="text-center1">Entry into Greensprings School is either by informal or more structured assessments, according 
          to entry level.</p>
          <p class="text-center1">Students seeking admission into Pre-School are assessed informally. More structured assessments 
          are conducted for those pupils seeking entry into classes ranging from Year 1 to Year 10 in 
          Mathematics and English. Students must fulfill the entry requirements for each class before they 
          are offered admission. Admission to IB at Lekki campus is related to IGCSE performance in 
          specific subjects.</p>
          <p class="text-center1">Most successful applicants join at the start of the School year in September; occasionally 
          students are admitted during the course of the school year based on availability.</p>
          <p class="text-center1">Our ‚Äúone school, three campuses‚Äù is an experience that we would love to share with you. At our 
          Anthony and Lekki Campus, we offer day and boarding school, whilst we offer only day school at 
          our Ikoyi Campus.</p>
